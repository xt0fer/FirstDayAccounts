# First Day Accounts

Items to be handled on first day orientation.

Open a Terminal app.
Ooh, ooh, Do this ->

Find the `shell` or `terminal` or `term` (all names for the command interpreter).

`terminal` or `shell` mean pretty much the same thing - `/Applications/Utilities/Terminal.app` and start it up.

Type `whoami` and the `enter` or `return` key. Congratulations, you just typed a command. You're Welcome.

now, type `git --version` and make note of what comes back, the version number of git.
