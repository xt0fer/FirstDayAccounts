Ooh, ooh, Do this -> 

    Find the `shell` or `terminal` or `term` (all names for the command interpreter. 
    
    `terminal` or `shell` mean pretty much the same thing - `/Applications/Utilities/Terminal.app` and start it up.
    
    Type `whoami` and `enter` or `return`. Congratulations, you just type a command. You're Welcome.
